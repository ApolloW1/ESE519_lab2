# Part 3
A 'sequencer' is achieved by python, which allows to record BOOT button presses and play them on the Neopixel, and also play a sequence of read/write commands.

The sequencer can obtain the value of register from the REPL in part 2 and also write it. User can choose either record or replay mode while setting the record length or the replay loops. The replay result can be shown by on and off of the Neopixel LED.
